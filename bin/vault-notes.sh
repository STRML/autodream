#!/usr/bin/env bash
# vault-notes.sh — collect operator notes from every capture surface into one file for L2.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `autodream-note.sh` appends to $AUTODREAM_DIR/notes.md, which only works from a
# terminal on this Mac. Notes worth leaving for the nightly run mostly occur away from
# the terminal — reading on a phone, mid-meeting, in bed. An Obsidian vault folder syncs
# to the phone and takes a note from anything that can write a file (Obsidian mobile,
# Shortcuts, Drafts, a share sheet), so it is the surface that actually gets used.
#
# Rather than teach PROMPT.md a second hardcoded path, this script merges every surface
# into ONE file — <findings-dir>/operator-notes.md — and the prompt reads only that. New
# capture surfaces are a change here, not a change to the prompt.
#
# THE ARCHIVE STEP IS WHY THERE IS A MANIFEST
#
# Inbox files are moved to processed/ after a successful report, so the inbox stays a
# to-do list rather than an ever-growing pile. `collect` records exactly which files it
# read into a manifest, and `archive` moves only those. Without the manifest, a note
# written during the ~10 minutes a run takes would be archived unread — silently losing
# the one note the user cared enough to write mid-run.
#
# ICLOUD DATALESS FILES
#
# The vault lives in iCloud Drive. macOS evicts file contents under storage pressure and
# leaves a `.<name>.icloud` placeholder; reading one returns nothing useful. launchd fires
# at 03:15 when nothing has touched the vault for hours, which is exactly when eviction
# has had time to happen. `materialize()` asks brctl to download the inbox and waits for
# the placeholders to clear, with a cap so a broken iCloud daemon costs seconds, not the
# run. If a note is still dataless after the wait it is reported in the output file rather
# than silently skipped — a note the user wrote and we could not read is worth saying.
#
# Every path here is best-effort: a missing vault, an unreadable file, a failed move are
# all logged into the output and never abort the caller. Nothing about leaving notes is
# worth losing a night's report over.
#
# Usage:
#   vault-notes.sh collect <findings-dir>   # write operator-notes.md + manifest
#   vault-notes.sh archive <findings-dir>   # move consumed inbox files to processed/
#   vault-notes.sh publish <report-path>    # copy the report into the vault for phone reading
#   vault-notes.sh status                   # print what is configured and what is pending
#
# Config (env overrides these; run.sh sources ~/.claude/autodream/config first):
#   AUTODREAM_DIR        default $HOME/.claude/autodream
#   AUTODREAM_VAULT_DIR  the autodream folder inside your vault. EMPTY = vault surface off,
#                        notes.md still works. Layout created on demand:
#                          <vault>/inbox/*.md          drop notes here
#                          <vault>/processed/<date>/   consumed notes land here
#                          <vault>/reports/<date>.md   the nightly report, for phone reading
#   AUTODREAM_NOTES_FILE default $AUTODREAM_DIR/notes.md
#   AUTODREAM_ICLOUD_WAIT seconds to wait for dataless files to materialize   default 30
#   AUTODREAM_TAGS_FILE  default $AUTODREAM_DIR/tags.jsonl — turns tagged with the focus button in the
#                        autodream-focus mod (mods/autodream-focus); the mod is the only writer
#   AUTODREAM_TAGS_LEDGER default $AUTODREAM_DIR/tags-consumed.txt — `<tag id><TAB><report date><TAB>
#                        <taggedAt>` per tag a report has read; this script is the only writer
#
# THE THIRD SURFACE: TAGGED TURNS
#
# A tag is a prompt or a reply the user marked, in a session, for the nightly run to take a
# close look at. It reaches L2 as a `## note: focus-...` block in operator-notes.md, so the
# prompt needs nothing new: the block carries its own instruction, the quoted turn and the
# transcript path (L2 holds Read). Two files, one writer each, because a tag is written by a
# session that can be open at any hour and consumed by a run that cannot see the session: the
# mod rewrites tags.jsonl, this script appends to the ledger, and "pending" is the difference.
# A tag is held for the report of the local day it was made on (judged here from `taggedAt`, not
# trusted from the mod) and is consumed by `archive` under the same gates as an inbox note,
# never by `collect`.

# Resolve the install dir the way notify.sh, review.sh and run.sh do: env first, else this
# script's own directory when it carries an install marker (install.sh writes `config` and links
# PROMPT.md), else the legacy default with a warning. BASH_SOURCE stays unresolved on purpose:
# install.sh symlinks the scripts into $TARGET, so the link's directory IS the install dir.
# Hard-coding $HOME/.claude/autodream here made the writer and the reader disagree the moment an
# install lived anywhere else: vault-notes.sh takes AUTODREAM_DIR from the launchd plist, so every
