# Oh My Pi (omp) harness adapter.
#
# An OMP session is an append-only tree, not a flat transcript, so unlike the claude
# adapter this one has real work to do: `normalize` linearizes the tree to the live
# conversation (linearize.sh), and `stats` reads omp's own record shapes (stats.sh).
# `slim`, `is-self` and the enumeration walk reuse the shared scripts, which already
# understand omp records.
#
# The session store is $HOME/.omp/agent/sessions/<project-encoded>/<stamp>_<uuid>.jsonl.
# Child sessions sit in a directory named after the parent file
# (<stamp>_<uuid>/__advisor.jsonl, <stamp>_<uuid>/<Name>.jsonl) and ARE sessions to triage.
