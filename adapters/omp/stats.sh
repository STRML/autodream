  # omp writes a tool call two ways. The main session loop emits a custom/tool_execution_start
  # record per call AND leaves the call as a toolCall block in the assistant message; counting
  # both double counts (measured on this host 2026-10-03: of 624 main transcripts with tool
  # activity, 614 hold exactly as many start records as toolCall blocks). An advisor transcript
  # carries only the blocks: 144 of 410 advisor files had toolCall blocks, none had a start
  # record, so they read tool_call_count 0 whatever they did (omp-autodream #114, item 1).
  # The start records stay the source whenever the file has any; the blocks count only when it
  # has none, so a main session reads exactly what it always did.
  # An advisor is offered read, grep and glob only; a call to any other tool comes back as a
  # toolResult whose text is `Tool "<name>" not available`. Those are attempts, not calls made, and
  # counting them would let an advisor that only ever hit the wall clear the noise gate
  # exemption for tool_call_count >= 5 (one stored advisor made eight bash attempts and got nothing).
  # They are matched to their block by call id and left out.
