# Merge the per-chunk L1 answers for ONE session into the one findings JSON that L2 and every
# other consumer already reads. Contract: tests/merge-chunks.sh.
#
#   merge-chunks.sh --check FILE
#     exit 0 only when FILE is a usable chunk answer: exactly one JSON value, an object, with no
#     "error" key and a "findings" array. Anything else exits 1.
#   merge-chunks.sh --session PATH [--elided N] CHUNK.json [CHUNK.json ...]   > merged.json
#     exit 0 and the merged object on stdout; 2 usage; 3 when any chunk fails --check (stdout
#     stays empty); another nonzero if jq fails.
#
# A chunk answer is UNTRUSTED. A worker can write the error object the prompt tells it to emit on
# malformed input, a bare {}, a wrongly typed field, or two values in one file, and a transcript
# can nudge it to. Such an answer is retried, never cached and never merged around: a session
# built from some of its chunks would read as if it were all of them. So the merge enforces
# --check itself instead of trusting its caller to have, and --check is the one definition the
# runner uses before it keeps an answer for a retry. It judges EXACTLY one value because plain
# jq -e judges only the last value in a file while the merge slurps them all, so an error object
# followed by a good object used to pass.
#
# No model call: the merge is mechanical, so it has to say what each field means when the
# answers disagree.
#   session_path     the ORIGINAL transcript, never a chunk file
#   underlying_goal  the first non-null one: the session says what it wants where it begins
#   outcome          the last chunk that states one: the end state is where the outcome is judged
#   stats fields     taken once from the first chunk. Every worker copies the same precomputed
#                    sidecar verbatim, so summing them would be nonsense.
#   findings         union, each tagged with its chunk, exact duplicates on (category, what)
#                    dropped, most severe first, capped at 10 (the schema cap)
#   other lists      order-preserving union, instructions_given capped at 3 (the schema cap)
#   meta             chunks (how many answered) and chunks_elided (how many the chunker dropped)
