# cc-autodream installer.
#
# Symlinks the scripts + prompts from this repo into ~/.claude/autodream/ and (on
# macOS) installs the nightly launchd schedule so overnight runs Just Work.
# Idempotent — safe to re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh                 # symlink into $HOME/.claude/ + schedule nightly job
#   ./install.sh /path/to        # symlink into /path/to/autodream/ instead
#   ./install.sh --no-schedule   # symlink only; don't touch launchd
#   ./install.sh --no-review     # schedule the nightly but not the review triage popup agent
#   ./install.sh --adapters claude,omp   # harnesses a run scans (names or `all`); written to config
#   ./install.sh --l2-engine omp         # adapter whose engine runs L2; written to config
#   ./install.sh --dry-run       # show every change, make none (no links, config, plist, launchctl)

  # Runs review.sh on several morning triggers (catch-up for the same reason as
  # run.sh: a slow run that lands its report after 08:00 still gets its triage
  # popup at the next trigger). review.sh's same-day launch marker (bound to the
  # report content digest) dedups the triggers, so at most one workspace opens
  # per report. Env must carry AUTODREAM_TRIAGE_SURFACE=cmux — the whole point
  # is the popup opening in its own cmux workspace rather than inline in a
  # headless shell.
  #
  # The report to triage is yesterday's (the date run.sh targeted: $DREAMS_DIR/
  # $(date -v-1d).md). review.sh with no date picks the newest report in the dir
  # — which at 08:00 is NOT necessarily yesterday's, it's whatever is newest, so
  # a still-running overnight report sets up the job to triage an OLDER one.
  # Pass yesterday's date explicitly (evaluated at fire time, not install time:
  # the \$(...) is escaped so the plist bakes the expression, not a frozen
  # date). review.sh fails fast with "no autodream report found" if yesterday's
  # hasn't landed yet — a scheduled job must not silently triage the wrong day.
  # The review job MUST have cmux or the whole point (the popup) is moot, and a
  # headless inline fallback would silently run claude with no terminal. Skip
  # provisioning unless cmux resolves at runtime the same way review.sh does:
  # a config-file CMUX_BIN first, then PATH, then review.sh's default /Applicat-
  # ions path (macOS GUI installs typically put cmux there and NOT on PATH, so
  # a PATH-only check would wrongly skip).
  #
  # NOTE: the resolved cmux absolute path IS passed through as CMUX_BIN so the
  # scheduled job resolves the same binary install.sh accepted — the launchd
  # env's PATH is fixed and a non-default cmux (e.g. ~/bin/cmux) would
  # otherwise pass the install check but be unfindable at runtime.
