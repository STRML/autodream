# Slim an oversized Claude Code session transcript so the L1 haiku worker can read it.
#
# Some sessions are enormous (4500+ lines, ~10MB, base64 images and giant tool
# outputs). The worker can't even read 20 such lines without blowing the 25k-token
# Read limit, so it gives up and returns an error finding instead of triaging — and
# those big sessions are often the most interesting ones. This caps the damage:
#   1. truncate every line to a max width (kills base64 blobs / huge tool outputs),
#   2. keep head + tail and elide the middle (which is usually repetitive churn),
#   3. hard-cap total bytes as a final safety net.
# Triage is fuzzy pattern-spotting, not strict JSON parsing, so a lossy but
# representative transcript still yields useful findings. run.sh only invokes this
# for sessions over AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES; smaller ones are read verbatim.
#
# Usage: slim-transcript.sh <src.jsonl> <dst>
# Tunables (env): AUTODREAM_SLIM_MAXLINE (400 chars), _HEAD (400 lines),
#                 _TAIL (200 lines), _CAP (262144 bytes),
#                 _TOOLRESULT (600 chars), _THINKING (800 chars).
# Modes (env, both off unless set to 1, so a plain call writes exactly what it always did):
#   AUTODREAM_SLIM_RESHAPE=1  drop Claude Code bookkeeping records by a TYPE DENYLIST and rebuild
#                             each kept Claude record with type and timestamp first and the
#                             message reduced to role and content. OMP records and any schema
#                             this script does not know pass through untouched by this step.
#   AUTODREAM_SLIM_FULL=1     keep every surviving line: no head/tail elision, no byte cap, no
#                             footer. For the chunker, which sizes the pieces itself at line
#                             boundaries; a footer would land in the last chunk as a line that is
#                             not JSON, which the worker would read as transcript.
# run.sh sets both only while chunked triage is on (AUTODREAM_L1_CHUNK_BYTES above 0), so turning
# that off restores the head/tail view byte for byte.

# Pre-pass: when jq is available, strip the bulky payloads that tool calls leave
# behind, before the line-based head/tail/truncate pass. Two transcript schemas
# show up here and they store tool output in completely different places:
#
#   Claude Code  content blocks of .type == "tool_result" inside .message.content
#   OMP          whole records with .message.role == "toolResult", carrying the
#                payload in .message.details + .message.content, plus a
#                .message.providerPayload blob on assistant turns
#
# Handling only the first schema is worse than doing nothing: jq still exits 0 and
# writes a valid file, so the fallback never fires, and the line pass below then
# spends its 400-char budget on ~190 chars of OMP envelope (id/parentId/timestamp/
# toolCallId/toolName) and cuts off at '"content":[' — the worker gets ID soup with
# no payload and no goal, and returns no findings. Both schemas are stripped here.
# The line-based pass still runs as a safety net for stragglers. Falls back
# transparently if jq isn't installed or the stream isn't parseable JSONL.
# CLAUDE CODE BOOKKEEPING AND REPLAY NOISE (AUTODREAM_SLIM_RESHAPE=1). Measured 2026-10-02 on a
# 3,479-line session: 36% of the lines were conversation, 24% hook and reminder attachments and
# 21% mode, permission-mode, last-prompt and bridge-session records. The head/tail pass below is
# positional, so on the raw stream it spent its whole budget on those and the worker saw about 2%
# of the conversation. Measured again on this host's store (24 hours of Claude transcripts):
# hook_success and total_tokens_reminder alone are 12,000 and 8,000 of about 33,000 attachments.
#
# A DENYLIST, never an allowlist of user and assistant. OMP transcripts come through this script
# too, and an allowlist would delete every one of their records, leaving a worker with an empty
# transcript and a findings list that reads exactly like a quiet night. It is a denylist of
# attachment subtypes as well, so a subtype this script has never seen is KEPT: keeping one costs
# bytes, dropping one silently costs signal. Kept on purpose: attachment/queued_command (the user
# typing mid-turn, the only place that text lives), attachment/skill_listing (SESSION_TRIAGE.md
# names it for the StructuredOutput rule and the missed_skill category), every system record but
# stop_hook_summary and turn_duration (compact_boundary is the compaction marker), pr-link and
# summary records.
#
# RESHAPE. Claude Code writes message before timestamp, so the 400-char line cut dropped the
# timestamp from a third of the lines, and the envelope (parentUuid, uuid, cwd, sessionId,
# version, gitBranch, userType, toolUseResult, message id/model/usage) used about 185 chars
# before the content began. The record is rebuilt with type then timestamp FIRST and only the
# fields triage reads. A key is added only when the source has it, because inventing a null is
# the bug the guards in the main program exist to stop. The thinking signature is a base64 blob
# that filled whole lines on its own.
