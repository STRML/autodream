# install.sh symlinks the scripts into $TARGET, so the link's directory IS the install dir.
# Hard-coding $HOME/.claude/autodream here made the writer and the reader disagree the moment an
# install lived anywhere else: vault-notes.sh takes AUTODREAM_DIR from the launchd plist, so every
# note landed in a file the nightly never opened. No error, no missing note reported.
