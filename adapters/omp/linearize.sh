# Collapse an OMP session file into the conversation that actually happened.
#
# An OMP session is an append-only TREE. Every entry carries id and parentId, and
# backing out of a branch moves a leaf pointer instead of rewriting the file, so the
# file keeps every branch the user abandoned. Read line by line, it credits the user
# with work they threw away. This script keeps only the chain from the live leaf back
# to the root, root first, behind one autodream_meta record.
#
# The live leaf is the LAST entry in the file. OMP does not persist its in-memory leaf
# pointer, and the last appended entry is what it falls back to when it has none.
#
# FAIL CLOSED, and callers MUST skip the session on a nonzero exit instead of reading
# the raw file. A line that cannot be parsed can change which entry is last, which
# puts the walk on an abandoned branch, and a confident triage of rejected work is
# worse than one visibly skipped session. Nothing is written to <dst> on failure.
#
# Design credit: STRML/cc-autodream#47 worked out the tree semantics and the fail-closed
# rule. This is a rewrite with its own fixtures (tests/adapter-omp.sh), not that code.
#
# Usage: linearize.sh <src.jsonl> <dst>
# Exit:  0 wrote dst
#        1 usage, unreadable input, jq missing, or dst is a directory
#        2 not an OMP session (no session header with a string id in the first lines)
#        3 produced no output
#        4 unparseable line, entry without a string id, or a broken tree
#          (cycle, or a parentId with no entry behind it)
