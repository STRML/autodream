#
# Why. Enumeration selected a session by file mtime inside the report day, so a session
# that was written to again after the day closed (a resumed one, or one still running)
# vanished from every later rebuild of that day, and a transcript that spans several days
# was read whole for each of them. The in-transcript timestamp is what says which day a
# record belongs to. The window is [START, END): local midnight to the next local
# midnight, computed with BSD date so a 23h or 25h DST day comes out right.
#
# The timestamp is the TOP-LEVEL `.timestamp` string, which both harnesses write
# (`2026-10-01T16:12:38.483Z`). An OMP `.message.timestamp` is an epoch-millisecond number
# on a record that already carries the string, so it is deliberately not read. A record
# whose timestamp is missing, not a string, or not ISO-8601 UTC has no clock: it neither
# selects a file nor lands in a slice.
#
# in-window answers YES when it cannot tell (no parseable timestamp anywhere) and the file
# was last modified before the day ended, so a transcript without a clock is placed by its
# mtime exactly as the bounded find placed it. An unreadable file is an ERROR (2), never a
# no: the caller keeps the session on an error, so a broken helper costs extra work and
# never reads as a quiet night.
#
# Timestamps are compared as epoch seconds, not as strings: "00.5Z" sorts before "00Z"
# lexicographically, which would misplace the boundary second. The fraction is dropped, so
# 23:59:59.999 is still second 23:59:59 and 00:00:00.5 is second 0, which is exactly what
# a half-open window over whole-second bounds means.

# Shared by every jq program below. No apostrophes anywhere in these programs: they sit
