#!/bin/bash
# Unit tests for bin/merge-chunks.sh: judge a chunk answer, and merge the answers for one session
# into the one findings JSON that Layer 2 already reads.
#
# Why this exists. A worker's answer is untrusted input, and the merge is the place a session
# stops being "some chunks" and becomes "the session". The properties worth a test are the ones a
# smoke test cannot see: an error or malformed answer must never be merged around, the merge must
# be total over wrongly typed fields, and the fields must mean what the header says when the
# answers disagree.
#
# Contract:
#   merge-chunks.sh --check FILE                     exit 0 usable, 1 not
#   merge-chunks.sh --session PATH [--elided N] FILE...   merged object on stdout; 2 usage; 3 refused
