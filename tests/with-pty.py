"""Run a command with a pseudo-terminal as its stdin, stdout and stderr, whatever ours are.

BSD `script -q /dev/null cmd` does the same job but calls tcgetattr on ITS OWN stdin, so it
dies with "Operation not supported on socket" when the caller hands it a socket or a closed
descriptor. This opens the pty itself, so it does not care.

The child's terminal is sent one newline and then end-of-file, so a command that reads a
prompt from its terminal gets an answer and a closed input instead of waiting forever. Its
output is copied to our stdout. Exit status is the child's.

Usage: with-pty.py <command> [args...]
